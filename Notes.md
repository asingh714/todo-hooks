# Hooks
- Hooks let you use state and other React features **without** writing a class.
- Hooks help us re-use stateful logic between components
- "Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy."
- "Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data)"
- Hook calls are just function calls. 
- Hooks let's us use more of React's features without classes.
